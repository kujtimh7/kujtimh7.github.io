        This word cloud shows the words from the song <em>”Diamond“ by Rihanna</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was generated by:
    <ul>
        <li>I found most frequent words using a hashtable in order to keep track of each words and how often they appeared simultaneously.</li>
		<ul>
		<li>For me to have each word print in order, after reading all the words (which worked as the keys) and based on the value tied to them, I transferred the key values to an array and I implemented a insertion sort to ensure it was in size order.</li>
		</ul>
        <li>The code was written in Java.</li>
	<li>This visualization was used to pay homage to the song, while also giving greater emphasis to words that were used more often then others.</li>
	
        <li>Using the <a href="https://github.com/kennycason/kumo">Kumo</a> Library.</li>
    </ul>

I chose this song because it was one of my moms favorite and would play a lot when I was little.
<br></br>
The song reached #1 on Billboards in November of 2012 and helped promote Rihanna's upcoming album at the time.
<br></br>
Seeing the most common words isn't to surprising, considering "diamonds" and "diamond" combine for 38 appearances ll together. This means that "like", "diamonds", and "diamond" make up for about 20% of the song!
If I had more time available I would of liked to learn other methods of showing my data through HTML/CSS through bar graphs, tables and maybe even a line graph showing if the amount of times the song has been streamed the last few years.
