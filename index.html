        This word cloud shows the words from the song <em>”Diamond“ by Rihanna</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was generated by:
    <ul>
        <li>I found most frequent words using a hashtable in order to keep track of each words and how often they appeared simultaneously.</li>
		<ul>
		<li>For me to have each word print in order, after reading all the words (which worked as the keys) and based on the value tied to them, I transferred the key values to an array and I implemented a insertion sort to ensure it was in size order.</li>
		</ul>
        <li>The code was written in Java.</li>
	<li>This visualization was used to pay homage to the song, while also giving greater emphasis to words that were used more often then others.</li>
	
        <li>Using the <a href="https://github.com/kennycason/kumo">Kumo</a> Library.</li>
    </ul>


Below is a list of all the words (374 words all together) with how many times they appeared, as well as their estimated value taking into consideration the song had sold around 7.5 million solo copies by 2013 (approximately $9.75 million) considering that a single word is worth approximately $26,069 (9.75 mill/374):

I chose this song because it was one of my moms favorite and would play a lot when I was little.
<br></br>
The song reached #1 on Billboards in November of 2012 and helped promote Rihanna's upcoming album at the time.
<br></br>
Seeing the most common words isn't to surprising, considering "diamonds" and "diamond" combine for 38 appearances ll together. This means that "like", "diamonds", and "diamond" make up for about 20% of the song!
If I had more time available I would of liked to learn other methods of showing my data through HTML/CSS through bar graphs, tables and maybe even a line graph showing if the amount of times the song has been streamed the last few years.
