Welcome to my interactive application called "Click Em' Up" !

The player can interact with up to 5 different objects in the game, can you find them all?!

All art in the title screen was created by me in Adobe Illustrator.
All art in the game was created by me in Illustrator or grabbed from PNGtree.com (bushes, trees and clouds)
Sound effects and music were provided by either www.fesliyanstudios.com or freesoundlibrary.
I do not own any of the audio.

Enjoy!!
